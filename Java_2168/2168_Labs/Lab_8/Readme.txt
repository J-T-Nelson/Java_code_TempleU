I didn't have any issues fulfilling the Lab. Though the instructions were quite difficult to interpret and could be worded much more clearly. 

I do wounder if there is a more elegant means of having alternative constructors which use different data structures (Hash vs Tree Maps that is)
  I attempted to use a constructor that took in an arbitrary boolean argument, but the behavior of the the SummaryGenerator class was a bit off it seemed by that means.
