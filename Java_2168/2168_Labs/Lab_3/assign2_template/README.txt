Hello Dr. Li / Moosa, I wanted to varify that my style of spacing in both this text document as well as my .java files is acceptable, in my IDE (VS code) I have auto-wrapping enabled, so I don't always start new lines at any strict limit as for me, it makes little difference to heavily format lines on my own. 
Let me know if you would like more line formatting than I am currently using please, as I am happy to accomodate. 

I have a question on line 51 of 'ManageVideoGames.java', I was hoping to get some feedback on. 
I was not sure if we are expected to ALWAYS handle incorrect input from a user when using a scanner, thus I did not handle invalid input for the removeVideoGame function, but otherwise did handle incorrect input in other scenarios. 
I assumed this was not a requirement since it was not explicitely mentioned in the grading criteria or assignment documents. 

I was not sure how we were expected to sort our list in the first place for the bonus, so I did some reading around to learn about the comparator interface and added it to the VideoGame.java class. I hope this is acceptable, were we expected to sort the list in a different way? 

I also was wondering whether it is good practice to NOT close Scanners which are reading from System.in? I have read before that it is best to close scanners after they are no longer being used, but this causes some issues with System.in.
