Hello Dr. Li / Moosa, 

I did not do the bonus for this lab due to time constraints in my schedule. 

I had no issue completing the base requirements. 

I decided to have 'null' added into strings generated from the various traversal methods for visibility; I recognize it was requested that the output not have 'null'
contained within it, however since it is simply a mater of deleting a single line of code in the 3 traversal functions I figured it wasn't important for comprehension. 

Thanks, 
Jon Tanner Nelson
