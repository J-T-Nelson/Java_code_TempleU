For this lab I didn't have any issues achieving the specified functions / classes. 

I added in some flavorful text and some system sleep-ing just to make the program feel a little more interesting to interact with. 
Sorry if the flavor gets in the way of understanding the behavior of the program. 
Maybe it would be more enjoyable to simply run it to verify it behaves as specified if reading through it is annoying!
