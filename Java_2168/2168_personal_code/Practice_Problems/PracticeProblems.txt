    - SLIDES 14-36 have guiding details and test cases for these two problems: 
    
1.  Write a program that reads a string and determines whether it is a palindrome
  -  COMPLETED... working on space and case sensitivity, I think the convention in java is to have overriding work for methods when there are variable amounts of 
                    paramenters which can be entered into a function. Java will also use alternately named functions for when they return something different
                    than a function with similar behavior. 
                    OK overriding is sub-class function overriding parent class behavior.. what I am thinking of is overloading... 
                    STRATEGY: 
                     - going to test overloading, just to see if I can do it in static methods. 
                     - going to 

2.  When analyzing arithmetic expressions, it is important to determine whether an expression is balanced with respect to parentheses
 - ^^ write a program to test if expressions input are balanced.
