This is a file which I wish to use for practicing with file objects and scanners
I will just fill it up with some arbitrary lines of bullshit
and voilia, things will be good, and I will be good.
I do not know how to spell that word above, and Atom is telling me like a good text editor
What bastard failure I and my family is for this disgraceful activity.
I almost shit myself right there
I am deeply tempted to do things that bring me a lot of dopamine, because they feel good, and I have been feeling oh so guilty
about the hours of indulgence I allowed myself this weekend, it has had me worried about damn near everything in my life
from how I look, to my health, the balance of my body, my teeth, everytrhing about Colleen too,
I have been worried about being worried a lot too, wondering if I would ever feel better.
I do feel reassured that I am somewhat well built, as despite these feelings I think I still was making decent choices today. I know these feelings
were originally sourced from the need to make better choices in some way, or the sense of that need at least.
I do not know what is right though. Aging scares me. My mothers healthy and inevitable death scare me. I think I need to just appreciate the ride
for what it is a little more, and that is a weird ride, where I don't really choose whats what, but I can sort of guide some of the energy in this world
and manifest realities with that sliver of energy... Ok back to programming, and life!5
