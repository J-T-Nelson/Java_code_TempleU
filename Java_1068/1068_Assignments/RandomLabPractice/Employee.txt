"Exactly what is stored in ed? laura?"
    ed stores the address to a Employee object, and laura stores the address to a Lawyer object. 

"Would it be legal to write the following? Why or why not?
 Employee ed = new Lawyer();"
    Yes, because inheritance describes an "is a" relationship. A Lawyer "is a" Employee, so we can store a
    reference to a Lawyer object in an Employee variable.

"Would it be legal to write the following? Why or why not?
 Lawyer linda = new Employee();"
    No, Lawyer "is a" Employee but the converse is not true; Employee is not a Lawyer.
